# Math to Code: A Java Implementation of Mathematical Concepts

## üìú Project Description

This repository serves as my personal playground and a structured collection of Java implementations for various mathematical and statistical concepts. The primary goal of this project is to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical theories and concrete, functional code.

It's a hands-on approach to deepen my understanding of both mathematics and software development, focusing on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

## üéØ Objectives

*   **Translate Theory into Practice:** Convert mathematical formulas and algorithms into clean, efficient, and well-documented Java code.
*   **Strengthen Problem-Solving Skills:** Tackle challenges ranging from basic statistics to more complex algebraic and analytical problems.
*   **Build a Knowledge Base:** Create a personal, reusable library of code for common mathematical tasks.
*   **Track Progress:** Document my learning journey as I prepare for my university studies in Astroinformatics and a career in data-centric software engineering.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Java

## üßÆ Implemented Concepts

This section will be updated as the project grows.

### Statistics
*   **Measures of Central Tendency:**
    *   `Mean` (Arithmetic Average)
    *   `Median`
    *   `Mode`
*   *(...add more as you implement them, e.g., Standard Deviation, Variance, etc.)*

### Algebra
*   *(...coming soon...)*

### Number Theory
*   *(...coming soon, e.g., GCD, LCM, Prime Factorization, etc.)*


## üöÄ How to Use

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MathToCode.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MathToCode
    ```
3.  The project can be built and tested using your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or via the command line.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Journey

This project is a core part of my self-study plan. I am a lifelong learner with a background in the military and logistics, now pursuing my passion for mathematics and computer science. My goal is to combine these fields to work on exciting challenges, such as the data analysis for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
